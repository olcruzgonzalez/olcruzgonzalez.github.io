I am a **Mathematician** with a five-year research career, beginning with a **PhD in Engineering Sciences** and continuing through **two postdoctoral positions** in France. This journey has contributed to improve my ability to formulate a research problem, integrate existing knowledge and strive to find solutions.

Parallel to my research endeavors, I have continually found myself expanding the expertise, embracing opportunities to develop new skills that aligned with my growing interest in the field of **AI and technology**. I am interested in driving innovation and solving real-world problems.

In recent projects, I have directly applied deep learning techniques, e.g. classical end-to-end approaches, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and **Neural Operators (PI-DeepONet)**, to solve Navier-Stokes equations with huge datasets of simulations resulting from the field of Fluid Mechanics. The goal was to assist/improve and/or even replace traditional methods of CFD calculations to predict the evolution of thoracic aortic pathologies at an early stage.

**Topics of interest**
- Scientific Machine Learning 
- Deep Learning 
- AI for Engineering 
- Data science 
- MLOps 
- LLMs
- Micro-Mechanical models 
- Modeling of biological and bio-inspired materials

*Please, do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to discuss how my experience, skills and enthusiasm might align with your team's needs.*
