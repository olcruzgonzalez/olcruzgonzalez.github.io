### Research project in a nutshell

Among the many existing composite materials, those reinforced with short fibers (e.g. glass or carbon, in a polymer matrix) can be made, for example, by injection or extrusion of reinforced filaments for 3D printing (Figure 1). These fast-growing reinforced filaments can be derived from recycled “long-fibre” composites used extensively in aeronautics and other applications [1].

To design parts made of such materials, it is necessary to determine the material's effective behavior, i.e. its macroscopic response when subjected to stresses (thermal, mechanical, etc.) at the part scale, which is much larger than the microstructure scale.  

Mean-field models [2] enable rapid estimation of the effective thermoelastic properties of a composite based on a representative image or statistical description of its microstructure. In particular, the spatial distribution of fibers, resulting from the manufacturing process, can be taken into account thanks to advanced models such as the Ponte-Casteñeda and Willis (PCW) model [4], or the IDD model proposed by [3] and gives a “unified” formulation [2] incorporating other models.

In this context, this project aims to determine the best calibration of these models from an image or statistical descriptors of a microstructure.
